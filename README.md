# Simple Parser
This project is a simple parser which (1) accepts if the input string from the user is a valid expression and (2) rejects the first offending token if it is an invalid expression. The input is also printed for cross-checking.

# Requirements
Since this program is created using the java language, it is advisable to run it using a Java IDE, 
preferabbly on IntelliJ IDE, as this is what was used to create the program. 
An updated version of jdk and sdk are also advised since this could cause errors if not compatible with the latest version. 

# How to Run the Program
1. Download or clone the entire complete copy of this repository onto your chosen device.
2. Open the project on any IDE that is supported by the java language. As mentioned, it is recommended to use IntelliJ IDE as this is were it was created. 
3. You can also opt to use your cmd terminal if you wish to do so.
4. Since there is already an "input.txt" file, you could already compile and run the program in your chosen IDE. If you wish to edit the test cases you can do so by opening the input.txt file. By changing the contents of this file, you can now process a new set of input/s.
5. After running the program, the results should have successful been generated then showed and printed in the "output.txt" file.

# Entry Class File
The file where the main function is located can be found in the ProblemSet_Parser folder -> src folder -> Main.java. Be sure to check if the input.txt file is placed in the same folder as the entry class file.
